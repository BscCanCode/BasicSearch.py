# Search Application
A basic Python application to search for elements in a predefined list, created by [Sid.py] on April 2025.

## Purpose
This Search App allows users to check if a number exists in a list, serving as a learning project to practice Python list operations, user input handling, and basic error management.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BscCanCode/search-app.git`  
   *(Replace with your actual repo URL if reusing, e.g., `todolist`.)*
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd search-app`
3. Run the script: `python search_app.py`  
   *(Rename your file to `search_app.py` if using a new file.)

## Features
- **Search Element**: Input a number to check if it exists in the list (displayed immediately).
- **Exit**: Safely end the application.

## Usage Example
1. Run `python search_app.py`.
2. Choose `1` to search.
3. Enter `12` to search (e.g., "The element 12 is present in the list" shown).
4. Enter `5` to search (e.g., "Element 5 is not present in the list" shown).
5. Choose `2` to exit.

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (while loops, lists, `try-except` for error handling).
- Known Issues:
- These issues are intentional in this raw version to show my current understanding; I may or may not update them as my logic develops.

## NOTE
- This README is created with help from an AI chatbot.
- I know it has some errors, but it runs too, the reason I kept it as it is: because I want to show people what I understood and develop a code according to my understanding, as my logic and understanding will develop I may or may not update the code.

## Fun_Fact
- I built this search tool in few "MINUTES"
